# Component and Open data exercises

This repository is for Dynamic Webpage -course assignment.

Final version is in this branch "no-router".

Note: the page still has "Daily news about electricity" in it. It is the open data part of the work, but the "News-api" used in it doesn't allow api calls from any other origin than localhost. News-component was in the router version on it's own page, but as I deleted router, I added news to the homepage, because i thought api would work.

- [From here](https://www.students.oamk.fi/~n3nari00/Dynamic_Web_Page/) you can access to the final service.
